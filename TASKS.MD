Here's the full, detailed, and structured list of **50 atomic 1-point stories** in markdown format to build your fully playable **Retro Lunar Lander** game using **Next.js (SPA mode)**, **TypeScript**, and **THREE.js**:

## 🚀 **Retro Lunar Lander – 1-Point Stories**

### 📁 Project Setup (Next.js + TypeScript)
- [x] Initialize a Git repository on GitHub.
- [x] Create a Next.js project with TypeScript (`npx create-next-app@latest lunar-lander --typescript`).
- [x] Clean up default Next.js template (remove unused files/pages).
- [x] Install and configure ESLint and Prettier.
- [x] Set up `.gitignore` for a Node.js/Next.js environment.
- [x] Set up basic Next.js SPA routing.

### 🎨 THREE.js Core Integration
- [x] Install THREE.js and its types (`npm install three @types/three`).
- [x] Create a React component that initializes a THREE.js scene.
- [x] Configure THREE.js WebGL renderer with retro pixel-art style (pixelRatio).
- [x] Implement responsive resizing of THREE.js canvas within Next.js SPA.
- [x] Set up basic animation loop within React (`useEffect`, `requestAnimationFrame`).

### 🪐 Asset Pipeline and Management
- [x] Establish a clear asset folder structure (`public/assets`).
- [x] Configure asset loading for textures/models via Next.js public folder.
- [x] Load a simple placeholder rocket model into the scene.
- [x] Load a placeholder Earth model with a retro pixelated texture.
- [x] Load a basic starfield background texture.

### 🛸 Game Graphics & Retro Effects
- [x] Implement a basic orthographic or perspective camera setup.
- [x] Add shader-based pixelation/post-processing for retro aesthetic.
- [x] Design or source a pixelated rocket sprite/model (mid-80s/early-90s style).
- [x] Design pixel-art style textures for Earth and other planets/moons.
- [x] Create animated retro-style rocket exhaust particles.

### 🕹️ Player Controls & Mechanics
- [x] Implement keyboard-based thrust controls (e.g., space bar for thrust).
- [x] Implement lateral controls for rocket rotation (left/right arrows).
- [x] Add gravity physics simulation pulling the rocket downward.
- [x] Implement fuel system with limited thrust capability.
- [x] Display retro UI fuel gauge on screen.

### 🌍 Earth Launch Phase
- [x] Implement a predefined orbital ascent path visualization.
- [x] Create logic detecting successful orbit insertion.
- [x] Add retro-style atmosphere effects during launch ascent.
- [x] Implement basic trajectory indicator guiding player to orbit.

### 🌑 Destination Planet/Moon Landing Phase
- [ ] Implement orbital transfer logic to travel from Earth to the selected destination.
- [x] Load and position planetary/moon models dynamically.
- [x] Implement simple planetary gravity mechanics for destination body.
- [x] Create landing pad with collision detection on the destination surface.
- [x] Implement retro-style landing sequence with altitude and speed indicators.

### 🎵 Audio & Sound Effects
- [x] Source or compose retro-style chiptune background music.
- [x] Integrate music playback using Web Audio API or similar.
- [x] Add sound effects for thrust, rotation, landing, and explosions.

### 🖥️ Game UI & Retro Feedback Elements
- [x] Add altitude and velocity retro indicators to UI.
- [x] Implement mission status UI displaying current objectives.
- [x] Add retro-font-based messages for player feedback (success/failure).

### 🧨 Collision & Game Over Conditions
- [x] Implement collision detection for rocket crashes/explosions.
- [x] Create "Game Over" screen triggered by collision or running out of fuel.
- [x] Allow players to restart from game over screen.

### 🎬 Menus, End Screens, and Replayability
- [x] Develop simple Start Menu with "Play", "Instructions", and "Credits".
- [x] Design and implement Instructions screen detailing controls and objectives.
- [x] Create a retro-style Victory Screen for successful landings.

### 📚 Documentation & Maintenance
- [x] Write detailed `README.md` covering setup, running locally, and deployment.
- [x] Document game mechanics, controls, and gameplay goals clearly.
- [x] Add GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipeline for automated testing/building.

### 🚢 Deployment and Testing
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel for public access.
- [ ] Test game across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- [x] Optimize game assets for quick loading and performance.
